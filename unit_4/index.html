		<h2>Believe Me</h2>
		<p>BELIEVE ME is an apparel company started by two women who were sick of the normalization of sexual violence. Our designs feature anti-sexual violence and pro-consent messaging in order to empower people and start a dialogue. Part of the profits go directly to an organization that works to stamp out sexual violence and provide support and resources for survivors. <a href="#">Learn More...</a> </p>
